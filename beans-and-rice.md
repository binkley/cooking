# Classic US Southern beans &amp; rice

There is a trick to this, but it is an easy trick.

Firstly, dried beans are resilient: you can undercook them, but it's hard to
overcook them unless you try.
I'm working with dried pinto beans [*]. Red beans [**] are a popular
alternative, especially in Louisiana.

1. Wash &mdash; day before<br/>
   Wash them.
   No really.
   Bags of pinto beans, even high-end, may include small stones, or "bad"
   beans. You can pick out some bad ones by color, blackish. So just drop the
   bag contents into a strainer, run cold water, and feel around.
   Easy.
   I'm using a 1 lb bag of beans (454g) from the classic Goya, a popular
   seller of Mexican ingredients in my stores.
   Mexican, schmexican.
   We grew these in the garden on the farm when I was a boy. :)
   (But note: cooking fresh beans is /not/ the same as cooking dried beans.)

2. Soak &mdash; day before<br/>
   How long is up to you.
   This is an example of how resilient beans are.
   In a big pot (several quarts), dump the beans.
   I go the slow way, but there is advice, usually on the bag, to speed
   this up.
   In goes cold water to cover to an inch+ above the beans (say, 3cm).
   Now put on the pot lid, and keep in the refrigerator.
   Even sitting out on the counter is OK if not for more than daylight hours.
   Time to go binge YouTube, and get a good night's sleep.
   You can also start early in the morning, and cook the beans in the
   evening &mdash; it's all good.
   Oh, did I mention to salt the water?
   Depending on your preference on flavors, salt the water, say a teaspoon
   (maybe 6g).
   This lets the salt soak into the beans.
   You can check the water with a spoon: it should have a slight salt
   flavor, but not be salty.
   As the beans cook down, the salt flavor intensifies, so be conservative
   at first about salt: you'll have opportunities to add more later.

3. Start cooking the beans &mdash; day of serving<br/>
   Finally you get to the real work!
   Not really.
   Plan for more YouTubing.
   Get the pot of soaked beans onto your stove.
   Keep covered.
   Bring to a full boil.
   Check the water level.
   It should be more water than you like &mdash; the beans will soak up 
   more, and you want to keep some of that amazing bean juice.
   Check the salt level again with a spoon; add more salt and recall
   that the finished beans will be saltier than you taste now.
   Reduce to a simmer, and add more water as needed.
   If they're at a low simmer but not quite boiling, you have the right 
   temperature.
   I always have to futz with the burner temperature so I don't boil, and I 
   don't just soak more.
   Let them go on like that.
   Time for more YouTube.
   I'll also check water level, and add some if they're cooking down too much.
   I like 1/2" (1cm) level over the beans for the juice.
   Use warm or hot water, and check that beans come back to a simmer, and 
   recheck that you like the salt level in the juice.
   *Key point!*
   Make sure when bringing the beans up to boil that you pay attention to 
   when they start boiling.
   The is the only place things can go wrong.
   The only way to ruin this is to let beans burn on the bottom of the
   pot.
   (If that happens, you can still rescue it, but prepare for some extra 
   flavors.)

4. Cook the rice &mdash; day of serving, or earlier<br/>
   I love my Zojirushi rice "elephant".
   However you make rice, go for a drier cook style, not wet or sticky. 
   The bean juice will provide all the moisture for the rice, and drier 
   rice soaks up the juice better.
   Leftover rice works just fine.
   Typical local rice varieties in the US South are long-grained.
   The rice can sit.

5. Finish cooking the beans &mdash; day of serving<br/>
   The beans can sorta cook like that for 1hr? 2hr?
   It really depends on how long they soaked, how soaking turned out, and 
   how firm vs squishy you want your beans.
   If you went for one of the same-day quick soak methods (ie, vendor on the 
   back of the bean bag), might cook longer.
   This is not hard to get right.
   Just give your beans a stir every 1/2 hr, and check how they &amp; the 
   juice taste.
   You may want to add salt or seasonings as you go along &mdash;
   a good reason to add some salt earlier, but not to level of your final
   preference.
   You're also stirring so no beans sit on the bottom too much.
   When done, they're a little spongy, but not mushy: think about what you
   want to eat today, or later days.
   (1lb of beans + rice goes a _long_ ways.)
   If there is too much water,  let them simmer with the lid crooked on 
   the pot so steam can escape &mdash; they'll get saltier, but the juice
   will be thicker.
   Key point here: as mentioned, beans are really resilient.
   Undercooked or burned is about the only way to go wrong.
   Overcooking just makes them softer and turns the dish into more of a 
   soup, which is still delicious.

6. Done &mdash; serve<br/>
   Put some rice in a bowl, pour over beans with juice, and picture living in
   Houston. ðŸ™‚

5b. Optional &mdash; extra stuff in the beans<br/>
   Common is to add some veg into the beans as they cook. 
   Typical might be chopped onion (white or yellow), garlic, jalapenos, 
   carrot [not my thing], or whatever veg 1) is nice to eat when cooked 
   for ages, 2) adds flavor to the beans. 
   This'll be your secret recipe for your family and friends.

[*] From Wikipedia about pinto beans: _common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). In
Spanish they are called frijoles pintos, literally "painted bean" (compare
pinto horse). It is the most popular bean by crop production in Northern
Mexico and the Southwestern United States_.

[**] Ah, Wikipedia. To be clear: do not mix up US red beans with Asian red
beans: _the kidney bean is a variety of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).
It resembles a human kidney and thus is named after such. Red kidney beans
should not be confused with other red beans, such as adzuki beans_. I think
only Yankees call these "kidney beans".

Follow-up notes:

- Beans and rice is one of the most balanced and economical meals you can make
- Cooking beans is really hard to get wrong, as long as they have your
  attention between boil and simmer stages.
  They're great when dealing with kids, client calls, the plumber stopping 
  in, etc.
- Pasta is fiddly.
  There's a window of only a few minutes between: undercooked, al dente, 
  soft, and time to make a casserole
- The above recipe makes food for an army.
  The stuff really goes a long ways
- Beans & rice are great with more stuff added in.
  I love to melt in a medium soft cheese like cheddar for serving time.
  I even sometimes dump the rice into the pot of beans, melt in the cheese,
  some chopped tomatoes, mix well, and called it "glop" (very thick to 
  stir): great for my college days when this stuff was nutritious, cheap, 
  and lasted the week
- Another Southern US classic is to mix in sliced, cooked sausage.
  The fat from cooking the sausage goes great, or you can be leaner by 
  draining
  Really any chopped, cooked meat works great
- I mention salt a lot.
  Actually salt generally works out OK.
  If oversalty, you can add water, and keep going.
  Again this is a recipe hard to get wrong.
  Remember you're mixing in rice, so I generally salt my rice to cook to match
  the overall level I want to eat
- Everyone's stovetop is different.
  For me, ~3/10 on my induction stove was a _low simmer_ (it has no 
  markings, so I'm eyeballing it).
  I miss having a gas stovetop!
- If you're in Texas, for rice I recommend RiceSelect
  Texmati (https://www.thekitchn.com/who-owns-basmati-texmati-23153188 &mdash;
  YMMV).
  It's a quality cross with an Indian basmati that grows well here
- I cannot tell you how many easy mistakes I've made before.
  Hopefully above instructions catch most of them ðŸ˜¸
